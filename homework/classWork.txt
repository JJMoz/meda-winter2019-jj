How many Cars do I have that were built between 1940-1960?

1) [Array] Look at where this year data is stored, found in object.year.
2) [Loop] In order to detect cars between 1940 and 1960 we will go through all the cars.
3) Create a counter that will count the cars that did match
4) Write a condition (If) inside a loop that will check for the year of each car ans see if it's outside of 1960 and 1940

5) if it does match year increase counter.

Class:  to have uniform data.
